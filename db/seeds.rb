She personally chooses every spice, flower and chocolate used at her shop, and she is pleased and honored to share them with you. <br><br>\n\nUzma began her journey in the culinary arts at the Colorado Mountain Culinary Institute in Keystone. There she explored a wide variety of cooking styles and influences but it was the idea that chocolate could serve as an artistic medium that interested her most.  Being an avid traveler, it only seemed natural that she refine her palette by tasting her way across the globe--from her native Pakistan to Andalusia and France. What finally lured her home to Chicago was an opportunity to study under the expertise of the chefs at the French Pastry School. There she not only earned her *Art de la Patisserie* but continued on as an intern to integrate her new knowledge with her personality. It was her chance to develop her own unique style.  She went on to collaborate with several Chicago area caterers--taking on the challenge of balancing high volume and the highest quality production. While serving as Head Pastry Chef at Wolfgang Puck at Chicago's Museum of Contemporary art, her surroundings inspired her to develop new tastes and visuals to adorn her chocolates. <br><br>\n\nUzma shares her excitement for the art of chocolate at Triton College, where she has served as adjunct faculty since 2006.\n", thumbnail_file_name: "uzma-chocolat.jpg", thumbnail_content_type: "image/jpeg", thumbnail_file_size: 39202, thumbnail_updated_at: "2017-09-18 21:40:23", city: "Chicago", state: "IL", zip: "60608", hours: "By appointment only.", current: false},

My expectation to myself as an artist is constantly shaped by my knowledge and experience as an art historian.

My experience as an immigrant, a Chinese American, a woman, a teacher, a curator, and an art historian has provided me with invaluable resources to draw from. I am interested in using portraiture and human forms to communicate my emotions and observations of the world. I use portraiture and figurative forms to offer a critical view to examine my own social and political environment.<br><br>   \n\nFantasy is not my concern, I strive to paint realistically and to accurately reveal the spirits of my subjects. Artists like Dutch master Rembrandt, nineteenth century painter William-Adolphe Bouguereau and contemporary portrait artist Daniel Greene inspire me for their dedication to their crafts. Their works demonstrate their superlative techniques in capturing their subjects'likeness and to convey the ideal of human spirit.<br><br>  \n\nOil on canvas is my main medium but I also use acrylic and employ collage technique in my work. I have painted homeless folk musicians, a Romanian gypsy girl, an Islamic human rights lawyer and restaurant customers. I believe in the importance of continuing to evolve and grow as an artist. Artists should constantly challenge themselves and explore new ways of artmaking. I would like to experiment with more subject matters and styles including landscape and abstraction.

I'm Floyd, I like to make stuff. I was born and raised in Antioch Illinois, a town an hour north of Chicago that hugs the border of Wisconsin. Art has been the main focus of my life since I was pre-verbal. In grade school I illustrated my classmate's book reports and was compensated with slap bracelets or pudding snack packs. I drew through every class regardless what subject I was supposed to be paying attention to. Within that same time period my family moved to the other side of Antioch and we built our own house. This is where I was first exposed to the wonders of carpentry. My Dad would let me have scrap wood that was left over from construction to keep me busy. Equipped with a handsaw, hammer, nails, and some fatherly advice I was off to build. There were two things I knew I absolutely had to build. The first project was to construct something or anything that I could jump my bike off of, and the other of course was to build a super rad fort. The wooded areas of my family's property is still littered with my forts, they're nice to visit, though I don't really fit in them anymore.\r\n\r\nI moved through life using both art and carpentry in separate capacities. I attended Northern Illinois University on a 2 year full tuition waiver awarded for my portfolio submission. I started in the illustration program, but was introduced to printmaking and there was no turning back. It wasn't until I was out of school that I really started to combine the two. I found a job with a clothing company as a Display Artist where it was necessary to have a carpentry skill set and an artistic eye. I traveled the country designing and building elaborate installations and display furniture. It was there that I developed the concept for Artpentry. Once I felt my career had run it's course I decided to go after a dream and follow through with my concept.\r\n\r\nNow Artpentry is functioning in full force. I wanted to be able to offer a wide range of services as well as have a forum to show and sell artwork. Artpentry can be best described as a creative umbrella for all of my artistic endeavors. I offer residential and retail space design/build services, fine art, wooden beards, canvas stretchers, blank serigraphy screens, murals, and really any conventional or nonconventional application of art and carpentry. Personally I've tried to return to the mentality I had as a kid when dealing with art. I keep making art because I love to, and of course to impress girls. However, these days I prefer cash over slap bracelets.", thumbnail_file_name: "artpentry.jpg", thumbnail_content_type: "image/jpeg", thumbnail_file_size: 70493, thumbnail_updated_at: "2017-09-13 22:00:31", city: "Chicago", state: "IL", zip: "60608", hours: "By appointment only.", current: true},

Through exhibitions, artist residencies, and community building, we are dedicated to cultivating voices, ideas, and practices based in the field of contemporary art. CAD seeks to serve the real-world needs of young artists seeking to establish their personal practice, as well as provide a breeding ground of creative collaboration and exploration. What does this mean? It means ongoing arts collisions between artists and media, interdisciplinary exhibitions, learning initiatives like workshops, and unplanned outcomes -- all stemming from our resident artist practices and their time at CAD.<br><br>\n\nCAD is housed inside of the historic Fountainhead building on South Halsted, in Pilsen. CAD has roughly 7000 square feet of studio, exhibition, and event space, used in many different ways by our artists and audience. CAD hosts an eclectic calendar of exhibitions and events every month. In addition, Resident Artists often work with other organizations to host cultural events such professional development workshops, exhibitions, or fundraisers.. The hosting of outside events is part of an explicit goal to support Chicago organizations while connecting our Resident Artists to other professionals in the field.<br><br>\n\n<b><b>Arts Learning and Growth</b></b><br><br>\n\n<b>We encourage our community to \"Try It!\"</b> CAD is built around the idea of learning through participation.  Resident Artists are encouraged to participate in as many ways as possible. Resident artists have 24-hour access and often learn from bouncing ideas off of each other, while also leading and participating in programs that are extensions of their practices.<br><br>\n\n<b>We ask our community to \"Make It!\"</b> An important part of our residencies, programs, and critical dialogue groups is to make! To push to create -- not simply experiment -- and to strive to finish new works.

Alas, access to the rear of a building requiring a stair replacement forced a subject that many urban dwellers fear: the loss of a tree. That necessary act became the inspiration to somehow keep the tree as part of the community, and the concept for Grove was born. <br><br>\n\nThe tree would not just be felled, it would be deconstructed and then reconstructed as a site-specific installation. The site: a retail storefront, fourteen feet high, twenty feet wide, and thirty-five feet deep. The tree: approximately sixty feet in height, with a canopy of roughly thirty feet. <br><br>\n\nAll elements from the installation came from this one tree. The artists used a lift to gain access to the upper portions. Working at a height of approximately forty feet, each cut was carefully considered so that the end result was five full size \"trees\", rather than the many \"branches\" generally created by a tree being felled. After much deliberation the first cut was made, producing the perfect result - a full size tree of approximately fourteen feet in height with a canopy of approximately seven feet. <br><br>\n\nThis perfection inspired the next steps in the site-specific installation, and the organic architecture of the tree was used to create a Grove growing inside a space. The juxtaposition of nature's architecture against the manmade form posed an unexpected change in relationship with the interior space. The artists were then inspired to continue the act of creating space, and the Grove took shape as a circular ceremonial space. Trees trunks provide defined space or walls, and the canopy provides a sense of protected space inside the larger built space. <br><br>\n\nAs the cutting and felling of the tree continued, the artists were inspired by leaves drifting to the ground and decided to further develop the idea of sacred or protected space by giving it a carpet of leaves, the smell and the delicate blanket offering that sense of peace found when in a forest in fall. <br><br>\n", thumbnail_file_name: "grove-4.jpg", thumbnail_content_type: "image/jpeg", thumbnail_file_size: 60418, thumbnail_updated_at: "2017-09-18 21:39:32", city: "Chicago ", state: "IL", zip: "60608", hours: "By appointment only.", current: false},

Her next journey would take her through South America and finally land in Colorado as owner of a small but profitable cafe in Boulder. In Colorado, she exhibited her work in Boulder and Denver, meeting fellow gallery artist Scott Multer and forming a bond that would last and lead up to their marriage. After a brief stint in California, Bridget and Scott arrived back in Chicago to revive their artistic endeavors and begin planting roots in her hometown. On September 11, 2001, a tragic day in America, they welcomed the arrival of their daughter, Annabel. The beginning of their family ushered in a return to her work of creating from that which is invisible.<br><br>\n\nIn Bridget's work today, she utilizes pen and ink to draw a narrative of imaginary figures and settings which transcend the physical world, portraying a wider vision of awareness including spiritual and mystical themes.<br><br>\n\nScott Multer<br>\nStarting his career in the late 1980s as a comic book artist and serving as a graphic novelist adapting Anne Rice's vampire books, Scott brought his love for narrative art to the Denver gallery scene. Here Scott met fellow artist, future wife and partner in the South Halsted Gallery, Bridget Bolger. Struggling to make ends meet as a fine artist, he turned once again to commercial art, specifically in the digital form as an entertainment software illustrator in California. His progression in the field led towards interactive art direction with a job first at Playboy and ultimately following a career in providing creative direction and marketing solutions for corporations in Chicago.<br><br>\n\nIn a return to his work today, Scott takes a unique approach to the visual form by collaborating with his wife Bridget to create a shared vision and experience.<br><br>\n\n\n\n\nContact<br>\nSouth Halsted Gallery<br>\n1825 South Halsted<br>\nChicago, IL 60608<br>\n\nsohachicago@gmail.com<br>\n312-804-8962<br>\nwww.sohachicago.com<br>", thumbnail_file_name: "south-halsted-gallery.jpg", thumbnail_content_type: "image/jpeg", thumbnail_file_size: 100719, thumbnail_updated_at: "2017-09-18 21:40:11", city: "Chicago, IL", state: "312-804-8962", zip: "60608", hours: "By appointment only.", current: false},
