We here at 4Art Inc gallery are proud to be rooted in such a creative arena.  <br>\n<br>\n4Art has exhibited a diversity of talented and dedicated artists since October 2003.   We aspire to empower our artists by providing them with a six month residency to show an evolution of their work.  The concept was simple; create a venue in which over a dozen talented and dedicated artists would rotate new works each month.  This idea was designed to promote a continuous visibility for artists as well as help artists and potential collectors form an all important connection. <br><br>  <br>\n <br>\nRobin M. Rios, owner of 4Art gallery, believes that in todayys art world it is essential for artists to be visible for longer periods of time in a single location.  Therefore it is at the 4Art Inc gallery where a client can watch an artist grow in an environment that is just as warm and inviting as walking into an artistts studio.  4Art is open five days a week and is one of the most prominent galleries in the Chicago Artistts District, Pilsen area.  Robin takes great pleasure in greeting and talking with her guests about the artists and the concept behind the group shows.<br><br><br>\n<br>\nWhen all is said and done, I want people to leave my gallery with a smile and with a new found appreciation for not only the artwork, but for the artists who create it.  I want people to find themselves excited about art and leave with an anticipation of returning and perhaps for their very first time becoming a collector.  Perhaps this is just a stepping stoneeto breathing new life into the art world.  Could it be as simple as just reaching out?  As artists we can sometimes find ourselves hiding in the dark, as an artists life isnnt an easy one to lead.  But since opening the gallery in October 2003, I feel that it has become my mission to continue to bring artists out into the light and help them, once again, find that excitement for creating art..<br>\n<br>\n\nReceptions: 2nd Fridays<br>\n<br>\nOther Services: CUSTOM FRAMING, GRAPHIC DESIGN, ART CLASSES<br>\n", thumbnail: File.new("app/assets/images/galleries/4art-inc-gallery.jpg"), city: "Chicago", state: "IL", zip: "60608", hours: "By appointment only.", current: false},

Alas, access to the rear of a building requiring a stair replacement forced a subject that many urban dwellers fear: the loss of a tree. That necessary act became the inspiration to somehow keep the tree as part of the community, and the concept for Grove was born. <br><br>\n\nThe tree would not just be felled, it would be deconstructed and then reconstructed as a site-specific installation. The site: a retail storefront, fourteen feet high, twenty feet wide, and thirty-five feet deep. The tree: approximately sixty feet in height, with a canopy of roughly thirty feet. <br><br>\n\nAll elements from the installation came from this one tree. The artists used a lift to gain access to the upper portions. Working at a height of approximately forty feet, each cut was carefully considered so that the end result was five full size \"trees\", rather than the many \"branches\" generally created by a tree being felled. After much deliberation the first cut was made, producing the perfect result - a full size tree of approximately fourteen feet in height with a canopy of approximately seven feet. <br><br>\n\nThis perfection inspired the next steps in the site-specific installation, and the organic architecture of the tree was used to create a Grove growing inside a space. The juxtaposition of nature's architecture against the manmade form posed an unexpected change in relationship with the interior space. The artists were then inspired to continue the act of creating space, and the Grove took shape as a circular ceremonial space. Trees trunks provide defined space or walls, and the canopy provides a sense of protected space inside the larger built space. <br><br>\n\nAs the cutting and felling of the tree continued, the artists were inspired by leaves drifting to the ground and decided to further develop the idea of sacred or protected space by giving it a carpet of leaves, the smell and the delicate blanket offering that sense of peace found when in a forest in fall. <br><br>\n", thumbnail: File.new("app/assets/images/galleries/grove-4.jpg"), city: "Chicago ", state: "IL", zip: "60608", hours: "By appointment only.", current: false},

Her next journey would take her through South America and finally land in Colorado as owner of a small but profitable cafe in Boulder. In Colorado, she exhibited her work in Boulder and Denver, meeting fellow gallery artist Scott Multer and forming a bond that would last and lead up to their marriage. After a brief stint in California, Bridget and Scott arrived back in Chicago to revive their artistic endeavors and begin planting roots in her hometown. On September 11, 2001, a tragic day in America, they welcomed the arrival of their daughter, Annabel. The beginning of their family ushered in a return to her work of creating from that which is invisible.<br><br>\n\nIn Bridget's work today, she utilizes pen and ink to draw a narrative of imaginary figures and settings which transcend the physical world, portraying a wider vision of awareness including spiritual and mystical themes.<br><br>\n\nScott Multer<br>\nStarting his career in the late 1980s as a comic book artist and serving as a graphic novelist adapting Anne Rice's vampire books, Scott brought his love for narrative art to the Denver gallery scene. Here Scott met fellow artist, future wife and partner in the South Halsted Gallery, Bridget Bolger.

I'm Floyd, I like to make stuff. I was born and raised in Antioch Illinois, a town an hour north of Chicago that hugs the border of Wisconsin. Art has been the main focus of my life since I was pre-verbal. In grade school I illustrated my classmate's book reports and was compensated with slap bracelets or pudding snack packs. I drew through every class regardless what subject I was supposed to be paying attention to. Within that same time period my family moved to the other side of Antioch and we built our own house. This is where I was first exposed to the wonders of carpentry. My Dad would let me have scrap wood that was left over from construction to keep me busy. Equipped with a handsaw, hammer, nails, and some fatherly advice I was off to build. There were two things I knew I absolutely had to build. The first project was to construct something or anything that I could jump my bike off of, and the other of course was to build a super rad fort. The wooded areas of my family's property is still littered with my forts, they're nice to visit, though I don't really fit in them anymore.\r\n\r\nI moved through life using both art and carpentry in separate capacities. I attended Northern Illinois University on a 2 year full tuition waiver awarded for my portfolio submission. I started in the illustration program, but was introduced to printmaking and there was no turning back. It wasn't until I was out of school that I really started to combine the two. I found a job with a clothing company as a Display Artist where it was necessary to have a carpentry skill set and an artistic eye. I traveled the country designing and building elaborate installations and display furniture. It was there that I developed the concept for Artpentry. Once I felt my career had run it's course I decided to go after a dream and follow through with my concept.\r\n\r\nNow Artpentry is functioning in full force. I wanted to be able to offer a wide range of services as well as have a forum to show and sell artwork. Artpentry can be best described as a creative umbrella for all of my artistic endeavors. I offer residential and retail space design/build services, fine art, wooden beards, canvas stretchers, blank serigraphy screens, murals, and really any conventional or nonconventional application of art and carpentry. Personally I've tried to return to the mentality I had as a kid when dealing with art. I keep making art because I love to, and of course to impress girls.
