In this new series, the artist lives and breathes, on grassy knolls between bailouts and bankrolls, empathy and apathy, pulled between the expanding universe and the collapsing consciousness of America. Jen's delicate line work and hand stitched thread, paired with aggressive splatters and drips of ink evoke messages of optimism and stability in times of crisis and uncertainty. As she meticulously works the lines around the mess of chaos, she strives to find a new path amongst today's weighty obstacles. While the world seems to be tearing apart at the seams, Jen looks to the silver lining, letting the struggle inspire creative momentum and a renewed sense of direction. <br>http://jenrosenthal.blogspot.com", exhibition_thumbnail: File.new("app/assets/images/exhibitions/3x5_3.jpg"), gallery_id:15},

Let us stop a moment to read these lines and put clearly before our eye the [colored architecture] against the blue or gray background of the sky. We must get that image into our HEARTS. And then we shall be able to continue (to see) our reflections.\" - <i>LeCorbusier</i> as remixed <i>by Amanda Williams</i><br><br><b>Chicago Art Department</b> is pleased to present <i>\"of REQUIEMS and RELIQUARIES,\"</i> work by <b>Amanda Williams</b> which explores new threads of inquiry related to her ongoing <i>Color(ed) Theory</i> project. For the past year, Amanda has been painting abandoned houses on the South Side with a highly specific, culturally coded color palette. For this exhibition she will create works that appropriate the idea of a requiem and a reliquary as metaphors for the houses she has objectified through her paint practice.<br><br>What are the rituals associated with the life cycle of these structures in these blighted landscapes? How can spaces that have been deemed to have no value and structures marked for demolition be deified or exalted in status? In what way are they relics? In what way is Amanda's practice a celebration of the end as well as the beginning? How might the detritus of these neglected structures be elevated to a more valuable status by imagining them as relics and not rubbish?<br><br>New potentials for the <i>Color(ed) Theory</i> will be tested via a variety of familiar and unfamiliar media, including: drawing, painting, laser cutter, models, photography and letterpress. Returning to her architectural roots, she will contemplate what form the recording/documenting of an unwanted architecture should take. In addition to the exhibited work, Amanda Williams will engage in a series of one-on-one conversations with a myriad of voices that have unique vantage points on the subject.<br><br><b>Amanda Williams</b> is an artist and architect whose work explores themes of personal freedom, value and identity. She studied architecture and practiced it in the Bay Area for a number of years before turning her full attention to the visual arts. Color is a central preoccupation in her work; her evolving palette derived largely from the urban landscapes she traversed as a child in the South Side of Chicago. Her most recent work focuses on deep explorations of the link between race, color and space.", exhibition_thumbnail: File.new("app/assets/images/exhibitions/AmandaBody1.jpg"), gallery_id:15},

Reactionary Drawing, a 15 week class taught at the Chicago Art Department, was an interMEDIA drawing class where students explored the role of reaction in the artistic process. Despite its name, the class was less about learning how to draw as much as it was really the larger artistic question of what to do with a blank canvas. <br><br><br><br>Most intro drawing classes teach you the tools and technique, or how to draww. This class asks well what do I draw??. says instructor Nathan Peck. Or as I like to call it blank canvas syndrome..? <br><br><br><br>Students, familiar with the process of coming up with an idea first and then putting it down on paper, were introduced to the idea of putting the marks on the paper first and then finding the idea. A drawing might have started by drawing on top of a video projection or with a simple instruction like start with vertical lines onlyy. Students were also regularly asked to switch and work on other studentss drawings.<br><br><br><br>I wanted to show that you can put things down on paper before you even have an idea. That you can make a mess and then try to find the Mickey Mouse in the clouds,, says Peck.<br><br><br><br>The merits of process based art have been debated because of its questionable results, however the drawings in this exhibition are not only polished, finished pieces, but compelling in their content and aesthetics. This is because as much as students were asked to make a mess, they were also asked to keep an eye towards a finished and resolved piece. As a result the drawings are an interesting mix of subconscious mystery and accessible clarity. Whether they are portraits or scenes, there is always some element of surprise, some interesting twist.<br><br><br><br>The real enjoyment of the drawings is, as Peck puts it, seeing surprise after surprise after surprise. Itts like being able to look into a test tube and seeing chemical reactions on a pagee. <br><br><br><br>This speaks to another aspect of the drawings which is their collaborative success. No individual artist can claim sole authorship of the drawing. They are literally drawings produced by a class. It was produced from a process of mixing, remixing and remixing again.<br><br><br><br>The most compelling things about these drawings are that we wouldnnt have or couldnnt have sat down and thought up,, says Peck.

I juxtapose these memories and mental images with random bits of visual information from the outside world. As I began to piece together these memories with other visual cues, imbuing my own imagination onto them, I became interested in the curious ways that one's subjective imagination shapes memory itself.<br>I began to think about the fragmented nature of memory and saw a symbolic relationship between the formation of memory and dreams. To piece together fragments of memory requires imagination, an activity that the mind does as it makes sense of pulses from the limbic system during the REM sequence. As dreams seem to mimic this process of collaging discrete elements of visual information in our brains, I similarly use fragments of random visual information from both the outside world and from my imagination in order to tell a story, blurring the line between fact and fiction.<br>As I was further developing the concepts behind this series, I decided that I wanted to boil these whimsical stories down to singular visual symbols as an analog to the mind's need to simplify, reduce, and refine information. I considered the merits of screen printing and concluded that the methodical, reductive steps involved in making screen prints would mimic this activity. In that way, the loosely hung paintings are the freehand whimsical environments, while the prints are more schematically produced and compulsively repeated symbols.<br>", exhibition_thumbnail: File.new("app/assets/images/exhibitions/WEB-250-Large-banner.jpg"), gallery_id:15},

Some see it as a powerful art making tool while others see nothing more than a phone. While the debate goes on, fine artists everywhere are making, sharing, and selling iPhone art. You can find iPhone art on the cover of print publications and online, also in galleries and in private collections. Wherever this device ends up inside of the fine arts landscape, there's a strong case to be made that the iPhone is at worst a flexible, powerful, and convenient new tool for contemporary artists.<br><br>\"iPhone Therefore I Am\" is the culmination of a class led by Chicago artist Mike Nourse, offered by the Chicago Art Department which features ten local artists who met weekly, working towards a completed project in areas such as photo, digital sketching (finger painting), animation, sound, and video. In addition to local artists, CAD program coordinator Mike Nourse brought in national and international iPhone artists from as far away as Russia, Norway, Spain, France, and Germany. The end-result is a comprehensive look at this digital tool and some of its artistic possibilities. <br><br>The timing to examine this device plays a large part in this exhibition. Chicago artist Jon Satrom feels the show is \"situated in a critical time-space where media-making tools are forking from traditional operating systems to mobile devices and artists are crucial in these transitions.\" And In an era where time matters more and more, the iPhone as creative tool presents a convenience that many other tools simply can't. Artist Mia Robinson from Washington D.C. says, \"I use an iPhone to make art because its the one tool that's always there.\"<br><br>This exhibition has brought together a wide range of artists from around the world, all excited to be a part of iHistory. From Spain, artist Luis Peso describes how this show has \"opened a door to the amazing iPhone Art from several diferent countries around the world!\" Matthew Watkins (Germany) feels that \"this show is further confirmation of the importance of mobile and iphone art. It's an epochal moment,\" From America, David Lebowitz is an east-coast artist who is writing a book on the subject and will be showing one of his finger-painted pieces. He says \"artists like myself were drawn to it like moths to a flame. I'm proud to be part of this exhibition, among the first on planet earth to feature pioneering, international efforts of this 21st century medium.\" Where is iPhone art heading? What type of artists work with an iPhone and when? Why? How does the iPhone fit into the contemporary art landscape?
