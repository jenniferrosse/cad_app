When I decided to change my career path to give room to my more artistic side, I moved to the US and went back to school. I tried my hand at interior design, but felt more like a director than a creator. So I began to craft the furniture that I wanted to place in these planned interiors. I worked as a furniture designer/maker on my own for 2 years, soon to discover that the restrictions of the need of functionality steered me more towards sculptural work. After taking my masters, focusing on wood sculpture, I've been privileged working in my own studio creating pieces with total artistic freedom.<br><br><b><u>Pam</b></u><br>Pam's art journey started as a young girl - her notebooks filled with colored pencil drawings of horses, frogs and the occasional mushroom. She knew she would always be an artist. Pam grew up in Springfield, Illinois and studied fine art at Southern Illinois University. Somewhere in the middle of college, her focus took a turn toward graphic design, where it planted itself for 25 years. Working in downtown Chicago, Pam became an award winning and sought after graphic designer known for her art direction, leadership qualities, and flair for communicating a message.<br><br>But her roots were still calling. . . As she's ventured back into the world of fine art, it seems her journey has come full circle. Today, notebooks are filled with color studies, abstract images and notes on new ideas for creating art. Since exhibiting her paintings professionally in 2009, Pam's work has won awards and been exhibited throughout the Midwest. She now strives to bridge her graphic design expertise and leadership with her fine art talent and passion for sharing the gift of art.<br><br><b><u>Hofheimer</b></u><br>Teresa Hofheimer is an artist and graduate of The Art Institute of Chicago, where she earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. She studied at the International School of Art, Montecastello di Vibio, Perugia, Italy. She has shown her work in many juried shows in the Chicago area, and her work is included in corporate and private collections throughout the country. Teresa was chosen by the Art Institute of Chicago to represent the museum in painting a cow for the public art exhibition, Cows on Parade. She has been the curator of exhibitions in the Chicago area.<br><br>Erwinovers.com<br>Pamartgallery.com<br>Teresahofheimer.com", exhibition_thumbnail: File.new("app/assets/images/exhibitions/crowd.jpg"), gallery_id:27},

The question remains the same, but the answer changes throughout your life. Your role, your position, your partners, friends, body, skin, mind, even sexuality. Most of these changes won't noticeably interfere with your day to day life, but issues around one's sexuality have always been more sensitive. It is usually a more private matter, and to visually share your gender blurring views challenges your environment. For some, this is a choice, for others, a necessity. Traditional views of gender and sexuality are less pushed upon the new generation and it opens doors to more freely experiment with identity. For a majority, it remains challenging to adapt to this changing visual expression of our inner selves. <br><br>Featured Artists:<br>Teresa Hofheimer, Adam Lofbomm, Erwin Overes, Dobrila Pintar, Harmonia Rosales, Lisa Stefaniak, Quinn Wharton", exhibition_thumbnail: File.new("app/assets/images/exhibitions/Harmonia_AThinLine_2-WR.jpg"), gallery_id:27}
