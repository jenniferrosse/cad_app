I have done this in the past by using neon, mind-altering colors, and experimenting with harsh surreal cityscapes and stark, pale, incredibly expressionistic self-portraits, and recently trying my hand at slightly surreal but mostly realistic back lit landscapes based on photographs that I have taken.<br><br>However, my art has taken a turn that is completely different from the processes I usually use while the meaning behind it, and more importantly the feeling I hope to yank out of myself and others, remains exactly the same. and I feel that by using this method and going in this direction, the feeling I need people to feel when looking at my art is being felt with much more impact than my previous works have been able to evoke.<br><br>Recently I have been painting vast, colorful, bordering on being completely non-subjective, sky and water mimicking works almost entirely with my fingers and sometimes using a large, soft brush. they range from small to gigantic, and when I look at some, I am devastated. when I look at others, I am completely at peace; and every variation of emotion in between. Which is exactly what I wanted but because there is no discernible subject to the works, it is much more easily related to on a completely primal level which everyone can understand. I still use most of the colors I did before, because they express a world of dreams of which one foot of mine is constantly in. I really feel like people understand that through these paintings, and I hope to continue with a fervor.<br><br>-Asa Von Hagan", exhibition_thumbnail: File.new("app/assets/images/exhibitions/Aug-2014.2.jpg"), gallery_id:28},

POSTERCHILD (Bob Garrett and Nadine Lollino) is bringing together dancers Lyndsae Rinio, Elisa Foshay and Sam Allen to create an evening of movement based on the concept of moving without our eyes. The focus of this installation is to close our eyes and move from within. What happens to our movement vocabulary, what changes when we let go of inhibitions by shutting out what our eyes see, and move from our feelings, our intuition, our inward inspiration. This is an opportunity to be truly seen; the dance that lives within us is experienced by mover and audience. Audiences may come and go throughout the exhibit. The piece will last between one and two hours without stop.<br>This is a free event, although any donations for performers accepted.", exhibition_thumbnail: File.new("app/assets/images/exhibitions/fd9b1bd4-8077-4131-8724-3bd21763fd9e.jpeg"), gallery_id:28},

Green with short performances by PosterchildArt (Bob Garrett, Nadine Lollino, Lyndsae Rinio) throughout the evening.<br><br>TEMPLE Gallery <br>1749 S. Halsted Ave. 1F<br>Chicago, IL 60608<br><br>Artist Statement for Jana D. Green<br>The obvious question is: Why do we make art? What is beautiful about this question is that there is no definitive answer. Each answer is as unique and varied as the person who gives it and yet each avenue of expression is tied to the very first instance of an individual choosing to be visually expressive. In the same way that an archetypical preacher is called to the pulpit, I am called to the making of art. I cannot remember a time when I was not expressing myself through creating imagery. Working this way is as natural to me as breathing.<br><br>I take inspiration for the content of my work from mythical sources as well as from the genuine delight in and bewilderment by all of life's mysterious meanderings. I also specifically reference the work of my predecessors. You will find tributes, portraits and hints (as well as outright thievery) of the artists William Blake, Charles Demuth, Michelangelo and others in many of my pieces. I weave imagery from the past into my own work as a method of carrying it into the present. It isn't simply that I wish to honor these artists, for they have earned it, but it is a way for me to hint at the continuity of the artistic process. I am stepping into the river a bit further down stream than these artists, but we are still in the same body of water.<br>I also employ a personal mythology in my work much in the way a fiction writer would use their own history to paint stories. I have an alter ego that I utilize as an expression of the exploration of the \"mystery\" embedded in existence. She is the superhuman representation of myself, an indestructible version of my own feeble attempts at being strong. She is the wounded healer and she often inspires intense reactions which I am genuinely pleased to induce.<br>As a creator of images I feel blessed to not be limited by the boundaries of the \"real\" world. Another world is open to me and while I don't claim to be inventing anything new, it is an honor to be pushing toward the edges of what exists and perhaps to create a door into a new place for those who are interested in exploring beyond what is known.", exhibition_thumbnail: File.new("app/assets/images/exhibitions/tumblr_mzm5raHaaO1r9hs7xo1_1280.jpg"), gallery_id:28},
