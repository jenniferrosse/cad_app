For her August 2014 exhibition she has taken a specific interest in people's lips. Ylisse has interviewed friends, family, co-workers, and more, asking them to share a story with her and her potential audience about their lips. It could be any story. She then has an intimate moment during which she captures an image of their lips. In the exhibition each photo is paired with its respective story.<br><br>Ylisse is dedicated to the empowerment of young people, especially African American adolescent girls, and warranting them access to opportunities that foster a spirit and reality of self-determination. Since she is so heavily interested in the development of you people, Ylisse has found that with the growing influence of social media, photography is one of the best mediums for getting a perspective on the lives of young people. 11 Seventeen Studio would welcome this opportunity to be a part of her story, and the story of those whom she captures.<br><br>\"People often tell me they cannot 'read me,' and I always think, 'No one should be read-- rather -- interviewed,' I know that everyone has a story and for the past few months I have been interviewing people, asking them to share <i>their</i> story with me about their lips.\"<br><br>This level of intimacy with her interest and the simple presentation of her work speak to the essence of what Ylisse longs fo -- provide people the platform to share their truth and you have unconsciously provided a stepping stone to self-determination, or simply a sense of freedom. <br><br><i>11 Seventeen Studio is owned by Paula Michelle, a woman of many talents. Her vision for the studio is to not only foster and house the work of various artists, but to appreciate the process to which their work has created.</i><br><br><b>Event Dates:</b><br>August 8th - September 11th (presumably)<br><br><b>Event Location:</b><br>11 Seventeen Studio<br>626 W. 18th Street<br>Chicago, IL 60616<br><i>11Seventeenstudio@gmail.com</i>The opening reception will be Friday, August 8th for 2nd Fridays.

They seek to advance the artist's personal vision, not to dissolve or negate it. Exploration, both internal and of the world at large, is their chief goal, whether it is reexamining old truths or retrofitting a synthesis of prior methods, styles and ethea with a fresh, new vocabulary.<br> <br>Mel Smothers, who joins us from Brooklyn, NY carries on a painterly dialogue with Warhol in his series \"Dear Andy: Postcards from Montauk.\" He overlays Warhol's iconic pop imagery with his own personal subject matter in an imaginative and thought-provoking way. Mel will also be displaying a limited edition book of lithographs and verse called the \"Wedding Book\" Album. <br> <br>Warhol once said he wanted \"to be a machine\" and Pindar Van Arman, a Baltimore, MD artist, accommodates him with his artificially intelligent painting robot named Dahupi which Pindar himself programs. <br> <br>In his Warhol Rag Series, Robert Furman, a Chicago sculptor, explores the interplay between video and sculpture where both relate to a common theme. He adopts some of the style of Warhol but adds his own expressionist substance by delving below the pop icons to detrivialize the subject matter--in the case of Warhol Rag No. 3, examining Andy Warhol himself. <br>", exhibition_thumbnail: File.new("app/assets/images/exhibitions/warhol-rag-3.jpeg"), gallery_id:48},

The visual arts risked becoming extraneous and had to reinvent themselves, slowly and surely, into and through abstraction. But, particularly with minimalism, the visual arts removed themselves so far from any nexus with general human experience that they paradoxically risked the very thing they sought to avoid--becoming extraneous to the world at large. Postmodernism, in this sense, can be viewed as a series of multifaceted attempts by artists to revitalize the visual arts with some measure of their own human experiences. The resuscitation of storytelling is just one example of that effort and it's beautifully brought to live by the artists participating in our Show. <br><br>Returning to us from prior shows are Mathew Hall from Salt Lake City and Mel Smothers from Brooklyn, NY. Joining them are Chicago artists Scott Multer and Robert Furman. <br>Opening night is Friday, March 11 from 6-10 pm and the show will run through the Second Friday Open House on Friday, April 8. <br><br>The Gallery is located at 1907 S.

      Robin Monique Rios, owner, director, and participating artist of 4Art Inc. gallery has, for the past five years, dedicated herself to representing artists in a non-conventional way. \"As the art world continues to change, we must continue to adapt and become as creative in our ways of presenting ourselves as we are in our artwork. My six month residency program not only gives artists a chance to show an evolution of work but it also helps artists to grow - not only by showing a larger body of work across a longer time span, but also by participating in the business end of the commodity that they produce. I feel that it important for artists to come out of their shell and be able to, with confidence, translate their art into words and be able to speak to others, educating those who haven't any formal studies in the arts. I am proud of the continued success of the gallery and the response we receive every month from those who visit. I look forward to what lies ahead as we continuously evaluate, adapt and move forward.\"<br><br>

      <b>ABOUT THE ARTIST RESIDENCY PROGRAM</b><br>
      The six-month residency is based on three goals. First, we look to foster an understanding of both the process and the work the artists create. Second, we seek to form a connection between the artists and the patrons. Third, we want to foster an appreciation for both the art work and the artists who create it.<br><br>

      <b>ABOUT THE ARTIST IN ACTION SERIES</b><br> 
      4Art Inc. Gallery began hosting interactive live artist demos back in 2004 which were held during our 2nd Friday opening receptions. But now due to our growing 2nd Friday clientele it was important to separate the two and so in May 2008 the Artists in Actions Series was born! A new Artist, which is also part of the phase group show, is featured each month to create live on the 3rd Saturday of the month from 1pm-3pm.<br><br>

      The \"Artist in Action\" series consist of two major components: the live creation of artwork and an interactive dialogue between artist and patron concerning the nature and meaning behind the artist's work.<br><br>

Works will range in mediums from oil, acrylic, sculpture, digital art, photography, collage, fashion, jewelry, and mixed media. <br><br>

      Some new highlights of the PHASE VI show include: works by Tom Keefer inspired by both historical and current events, which demonstrate his perspective as a self-proclaimed post-9/11 artist; collages by Laura Lein-Svencner representing moments in time when the mind wanders through both beautiful and troubling territory; works by Steven Cox characterizing his search for balance among the chaos of modern life; and paintings by Jason Brammer portraying a photo-surrealistic view of the future. <br><br>

      Additionally, each month's opening will feature a range of unique events from fashion shows to live artist creations. <br><br>

      Jerodds work is heavily influenced by his love of nature that was instilled in him at a young age. Hiking and backpacking have been a life long passion. Since his move to Chicago, many of his works have explored the interplay of natural and urban forms, and the relationship between humanity and nature. He uses a variety of different media, including photography, charcoal, oil, and polymer media, and is constantly exploring new styles.<br><br><br>

      LOVE AND BEAUTY<br><br>
      4Art Inc., in coordination with Michael Underwood, is proud to present oil paintings by Chicago-based artist Robert W. Lee. Mr. Lee is an accomplished artist of the 19400s and 19500s who is releasing his work to collectors after years of seclusion. Although Mr. Lee has not shown his work in Chicago for over eighteen years, his history of showing in galleries, exhibitions and fairs is broad, from Greenwich Village, and The Cleveland Museum of Art, to international arenas in Yugoslavia, Austria, France and Italy. Exhibits were also held in Chicagoos R.H. Love Gallery and the Old Town Art Fair.<br><br><br>
      Robert Leees work is a flash from the past with a glimpse of the future. The detail of his work is unique among artist of our time, with its complex palette and detailed elements. Many of the paintings are so painstakingly detailed that they appear to have been produced by a machine.<br><br><br>
      The upcoming unveiling of Mr. Robert Leees work is a look into a Chicago artist that has been here for over fifty years and continues to develop his unique style.<br><br><br>
      Also Featuring Artists: Michael Thompson, Tom Latimer and Michael Underwood.<br><br><br>

It was not till the 18th century that art prints began to be considered as originals and not until the 19th that artists began to produce limited editions and sign their prints along with the technical information necessary to authenticate the work.<br><br><br>
      <br>
      The Printmaker is not just an Artist, but a craftsman, a hands-on Laborer whoos intensive process adds a new dimension to an original piece of artwork, transforming a mere drawing into something more sublime through one or another of the processes or techniques: etchings, woodcuts, silkscreen, lino cuts, etc.<br><br><br>

      Robert Treese is a mixed media artist, producing mostly two dimensional works. His non-representational pieces explore the swirling, ambiguous, and sometimes turbulent aspects of the subconscious. Robertts unique style acts as a sort of Rorschach test, where the viewer is encouraged to let his/her imagination assign meaning to the artwork.<br>

      Al Ribskis is an armature Formula car racer and former sign shop owner. His experience with neon signs has now led him into the realms of sculpture. Alls creations are minimalist, yet striking interactions of concrete forms and glowing neon tubes.<br>

      BLACK XMAS:<em>AMARGA NAVIDAD</em><br>In the summer of 2004, Castillo was preparing for his \"Minimalist<br>
      Reassertions\" exhibition at the Glass Curtain Gallery at the Columbia<br>
      College which opened Sept 13, 2004. He felt this urge to do a piece reflective of Hokusai's famous print, \"The Great Wave.\" He visualized this<br>
      wave made from twigs. Two of these were done, one in his studio,and the other at the Glass Curtain. Little did he know that by the end of<br>
      the year, he would paint \"black waves full of wood\" in reference to the chaos of tragic proportions caused by the Asian Tsunami the day after Christmas.<br><br><br>
      <br>
      TWO FOR 99 CENTS<BR>A commentary on the ridiculous prices on the art market, where works sell for millions of dollars and of the control that is exercised to promote and maintain an ever increasing growth of wealth (through the sale of art) for the benefit of a few. It is also an answer to those people who criticize Castillo's own work for being too expensive.He says, \"Forty years ago I would sell an 88x 122 painting for $160.00, and today people still want to pay the same price! Yes, art should go up in value as the years go by, but this process is totally out of control at both ends of the art market spectrum\"<br><br>On his involvement with art, Mario Castillo says, \"I feel a sense of<br>
      responsibility to be true to myself and to my personal history. This in<br>
      turn gives me the foundation with which I approach and interpret my<br>
      environment, society, and the world. My painting should be and is a<br>
      synthesis of all the input which exists within my total self.\"<br><br> <br>
      Of Chicago's pioneer artists of the 1960's mural movement, Mario Castillo<br>
      was the first to start painting murals at Lane Tech in 1964. He also did<br>
      the first Latino mural, the first multicultural mural, and the first<br>
      anti-Vietnam War mural. His unique approach to mural painting with youth served as a prototype for future muralists. He now teaches mural painting<br>
      classes at Columbia. His work is in the collections of ten museums<br>
      throughout the states, from the National Museum of American Art, in<br>
      Washington, D.C. to The San Francisco Museum of Contemporary Art.<br><br> Castillo received his BFA from the School of the Art Institute, Chicago and an MFA from the California Institute of the Arts. He currently resides in Chicago and teaches at Columbia University.<br><br><br>

      This new body of work consists of abstract pieces with acrylic <br>
      and oil mediums, on various surfaces ranging from canvas to metal. These <br>
      works were influenced by the random compositions created in public places <br>

      compositions that focus on the placement and balance of color.<br><br><br>

      Ruben is originally from the Chicagoland area, and spent most of <br>

      scale mural projects. He spent some years working as a mural instructor for <br>
      various non profit organizations, and eventually worked as an art therapy <br>
      counselor for a residential treatment facility working with troubled teens. <br>
      He has now moved on to abtract paintings which are indirectly influenced by <br>

      Immy has a series called \"lovers\" which are couples embracing one another. They portray the wonderfulness of love between two people who care deeply about each other.

His works have been on display in Chicago, Washington D.C. and Los Angeles to name a few. He continues to invoke emotion through his expressive paintings and impressionistic work.

      The long awaited solo show by one of the most forward thinking, environmentally, and symbiotic sculpture of the new epoch will debut his highly anticipated body of work during Chicago Arts District 2nd Friday Gallery Nights at Artistic Jeanius. A native of Seattle, Washington Maikoiyo Alley-Barnes is a self-taught refuse alchemist that has a super natural ability to create beauty out of the world's discarded material. With over 25 curated, participated in, soloed, and/or conceptualized to fruition both in gallery and independent settings. Maikoiyo is a voice to be heard in a movement where social, environmental, and political consciousness speak of change for a brighter future. 
      <br><br>
      Maikoiyo's process is based on the principles of addition, compression and stabilization. There is no burning, no molding and minimal subtraction; thus little physical waste. It is quite literally bent and bound, mummified trash. The pieces average 5lbs in weight. This is no arbitrary #. Each of us is responsible for approximately 4.8lbs of waste deposited into landfills daily. He does not sketch, rarely uses models or pre-conceptualizes on any given piece. He lets his impressions of the items pre-existing shape dictate its destiny. From there he builds out, compresses, and fortifies. Maikoiyo only uses masking tape, scissors, and his two hands as tools.

      There will be a public reception with the artist in attendance on July 11, 2008 from 6 pm until. The reception features complimentary food and drink specially paired with wines provided by A-Vision Chicago, and live music from DJ DV One from the legendary crew Rock Steady.

      Chicago, June 13, 2008: Artistic Jeanius will host its 2nd Friday of June 2008. With a second month with Christophe Roberts who showed the Chicago Arts District the Ski Mask Way. The exhibition starts at 6PM to 10 PM and will be held 1711 S. Halsted St. The neighborhood exhibition is free to the public and will incorporate a mixture of live musical entertainment, food, fun and a place to start the weekend right. 
      The Ski Mask Way to Christophe represents the removal of the ego and by putting on the mask it represents the unity of people without their self-identity. The show also is a representation of artist and designers doing what it takes to be successful. And what it takes according to Christophe is artist being individuals and respecting each other, and yet at the same time helping each other and giving a hand when needed. 
      The exhibition opened on May 9th with the Daris Jasper the gallery owner, in the window tied with rope and duck tape over his mouth portraying what a lot of young artist refer to as the gallery owner who inhibits the opportunity for up-and-coming artist. The first 50 guest all received ski mask and wore them through the duration of the performance art. It gave the impression as if Christophe took over the gallery to have a show. At first glance the show had a negative theme, however the message was positive. The message was to succeed we have to work together and be a community. Christophe also released his new summer t-shirt line called Cicada at his opening. 
      Artistic Jeanius opened as an art gallery/clothing boutique and is rapidly evolving into what we call an art-house offering much more, but still keeping a focus on fine art and fashion produced by local Chicago artist and designers.

      with hanging sneakers that honor memories of local legends, to Saturday morning cartoons and comic books celebrating the triumphs of mythological heroes. Art Director Daris Jasper says, \"Hebru is a visual narrator telling stories you want to hear over and over again, but in Hebru's instance, stories you want to see more than once.\" Traditionally his medium may have been words or incantation. In the now he has his brushes, aerosol cans and whatever
      else he can utilize to visually relay the many images and messages that are sent to him.
      Showing aside Hebru is Immy Mullen who is unveiling the \"New\" Mona Lisa.

Giving new life to discarded objects and finding the beauty in what is broken is an inspiring process. <br><br>While the material is often the starting point, it becomes about finding a sense of unity between material and image, a space where imperfections, beauty, light and darkness can all coexist. Combining the warmth of distressed wood canvases with elusive and radiant figures creates an unlikely duality. The mood is peaceful and haunting, perfect and flawed.<br><br>A lot of people ask me who my women are. They're not specific people as much as they are representations of thoughts, feelings, ideas and experiences. So many stories go through my mind as I work- she feels safe, she tries to let go, she emerges from a storm, she wants to be at peace, she descends under the weight, she pushes and pulls- internal battles that are familiar to all of us. In the end, the stories fall away as I look to feel and create a sense of balance.", exhibition_thumbnail: File.new("app/assets/images/exhibitions/Deva-Suckerman_holdingspace-(002)-WR.jpg"), gallery_id:13},

These exhibitors approach figurative work with a unique and relative perspective. Each artist displays work with varied and personal vision relative to contemporary figurative artistic discourse.

Born in 1989, he is a Chicagoland native who currently lives and works out of Pilsen. Holding nature in the highest regard, his work is rooted in perceptual observation. When suitable, he'll create drawings and sculpture. Gomez's work has been featured in numerous shows, last of which was \"Below,\" a group show held in Pilsen October 14th 2011. His work also rests in many private collections throughout Chicagoland. He struggles with women and whiskey but enjoys them both. He also enjoys swimming and petting dogs. In his upcoming show \"Below II\" Gomez will show beside a new line-up of artists. <br><br><br><b>Adam Nowak</b><br>Adam is currently attending the American Academy of Art studying oil painting and working towards his Bachelors of Fine Art. His work consists mainly of subject matter observed directly from life. Always intrigued by the way the light falls upon a subject and the way it can reveal form and color in an infinite amount of ways, he works at portraying that. <br><br>\"I have a strong belief that sculpting goes hand in hand with painting across, with, and through the form. The way each brushstroke is laid down and altered is a record of my understanding and knowledge of what I see and my mind's interpretation. My method started out very clean cut and direct. No alterations to the paint were made unless corrected by an upcoming stroke but as time goes on I see myself breaking free of that foundation, loosening the grip I taught myself to hold onto, and exploring new ways to manipulate and express my interpretation.\"<br><br><br><b>Jonathan Romero</b><br>Jonathan is a Chicago based representational artist who works traditionally in oil paints. He is currently attending the American Academy of Art and working towards a Bachelors in Fine Art. Recently he was awarded First Place in a juried exhibition at the Bill L. Parks Gallery in Chicago. His work has also been part of a Juried Group Exhibition in the Elmhurst Art Museum.<br><br>\"My work is derived from the observation of life. I am fascinated by the plethora of qualities that make up and define people's commonalities as well as their uniqueness. I choose to paint people for whom I have admiration and respect. I position my models looking down on the viewer to give them an authoritative presence. I do this not to demean the viewer, but to share my admiration and respect for the people I choose to paint. I aim to capture the presence and energy I see and admire in these people. <br><br>I have recently started sculpting in the past couple years and really have developed a passion for it. It's a completely different way of expressing myself that I truly look forward to continue exploring.\"<br> <br><br><b>Nathan Graves Tuttle</b><br>Nathan Graves Tuttle was born in Rockford, Illinois and relocated to Chicago in 2008. He received a BFA in Life Drawing from the American Academy of Art in the summer of 2012. The majority of his work is in charcoal, though he also does work in pastel, oil paint, and the occasional sculpture. His main subjects are figures, space, and plant life, often depicting all three together. His debut show \"Below\" in 2011 gave Pilsen a sampling of his various curiosities, and this year \"Below II\" offers a more refined representation of his abilities and infatuations.<br><br>\"I cannot describe how strange I think it is to be alive, so I continue to draw pictures in an attempt to understand this thing we call life. This, of course, is futile. \" <br><br><br><b>James Wisdom</b><br>James Wisdom is a graduate of the American Academy of Art with a specialization in oil painting. He was listed on the President's List for academic achievement and also served as a student advisor on the school's panel for accreditation. He has also been lucky enough to have incredible patrons who appreciate his approach to painting and as a result, James has been consistently selling commissioned artwork since 2001.<br><br>His work consists mainly of oil paintings that are produced after an extensive design process and are generally representational in subject matter. His approach to image making has been developed through years of careful study as well as his experiences working with clients on various commissions. James advocates an attitude of lifelong learning and is interested in bringing understanding through his work. He has lived in Chicago's Pilsen neighborhood since 2007 and is constantly inspired by the people and art that define the colorful community.<br>", exhibition_thumbnail: File.new("app/assets/images/exhibitions/IMG_0632.jpg"), gallery_id:128},

Some are, to be sure, but I'm afraid on the whole the truth is much more nuanced. It seems only fair to try to show a broader emotional spectrum than the police are usually afforded.<br><br>This body of work uses the police as a jumping-off point for a dark and occasionally funny look at the increasing aggression in American culture. I find in the police several contradictions. They are our heroes and our villains. They have incredibly dangerous jobs that are often quite mundane. Their calling is one of bureaucracy and brute force. They are thrown, bodily, at the problems of the world yet are, as an institution, one of the biggest problems themselves. They are civil soldiers, and they are people, too. <br><br>The work here attempts to humanize the police, the good cops and the bad, and to personify our aggressive incivility. A riot cop hiding his face in shame. A police shield emblazoned with \"Nice To Meet You.\" A shooting range target of a terrified woman.<br><br>My drawings aspire to be at once engaging, entertaining, well-crafted, and unsettling. Set against empty white backgrounds, these are cops alone in space, frozen for your consideration.<br><br><b>Damien James</b><br><br>The catalyst for my current drawings is Jonathan Lethem's short story The Collector. From literal illustration of visual elements that appear in the text to a more idiosyncratic reading of currents running throughout, my intention was to simply share influence; where this story took my own slow and methodical collection mania, the euphoria, delusion and obsession connected to accumulation and the need to eventually reduce, as well as the solitary mystery of what compels people to collect what they do. <br><br>Several drawings also take direction from typography, stemming from my teenage years cutting hot-waxed type in the Chicago Tribune's composing room. I viewed text as the medium to create something beautiful, collections of letters arrayed on the page. This time was also salient for me as a reader, the space between letters drawing me into words, the words drawing me into meaning.<br><br>Bio<br>Damien James is a self-taught artist and writer.
