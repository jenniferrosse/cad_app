I prefer to leave my art to be ambiguous, with intent to give the viewer more control, but also to give the work room to change. My work takes on many different forms so that its not limited to one aesthetic. Techniques used include; printmaking, woodworking, painting, sculpture, drawing, and digital media. Using combinations of these methods allows for a diverse body of work that can serve multiple purposes while balancing elements of decoration and function.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b><u>Artist Biography</b></u><br>\r\n\r\nHello... I'm Floyd, I like to make stuff. I was born and raised in Antioch Illinois, a town an hour north of Chicago that hugs the border of Wisconsin. Art has been the main focus of my life since I was pre-verbal. In grade school I illustrated my classmate's book reports and was compensated with slap bracelets or pudding snack packs. I drew through every class regardless what subject I was supposed to be paying attention to. Within that same time period my family moved to the other side of Antioch and we built our own house. This is where I was first exposed to the wonders of carpentry. My Dad would let me have scrap wood that was left over from construction to keep me busy. Equipped with a handsaw, hammer, nails, and some fatherly advice I was off to build. There were two things I knew I absolutely had to build. The first project was to construct something or anything that I could jump my bike off of, and the other of course was to build a super rad fort. The wooded areas of my family's property is still littered with my forts, they're nice to visit, though I don't really fit in them anymore.\r\n\r\nI moved through life using both art and carpentry in separate capacities. I attended Northern Illinois University on a 2 year full tuition waiver awarded for my portfolio submission. I started in the illustration program, but was introduced to printmaking and there was no turning back. It wasn't until I was out of school that I really started to combine the two. I found a job with a clothing company as a Display Artist where it was necessary to have a carpentry skill set and an artistic eye. I traveled the country designing and building elaborate installations and display furniture. It was there that I developed the concept for Artpentry. Once I felt my career had run it's course I decided to go after a dream and follow through with my concept.\r\n\r\nNow Artpentry is functioning in full force. I wanted to be able to offer a wide range of services as well as have a forum to show and sell artwork. Artpentry can be best described as a creative umbrella for all of my artistic endeavors. I offer residential and retail space design/build services, fine art, wooden beards, canvas stretchers, blank serigraphy screens, murals, and really any conventional or nonconventional application of art and carpentry. Personally I've tried to return to the mentality I had as a kid when dealing with art. I keep making art because I love to, and of course to impress girls. However, these days I prefer cash over slap bracelets.", thumbnail: File.new("app/assets/images/galleries/artpentry.jpg"), city: "Chicago", state: "IL", zip: "60608", hours: "By appointment only.", current: true},

Through exhibitions, artist residencies, and community building, we are dedicated to cultivating voices, ideas, and practices based in the field of contemporary art. CAD seeks to serve the real-world needs of young artists seeking to establish their personal practice, as well as provide a breeding ground of creative collaboration and exploration. What does this mean? It means ongoing arts collisions between artists and media, interdisciplinary exhibitions, learning initiatives like workshops, and unplanned outcomes -- all stemming from our resident artist practices and their time at CAD.<br><br>\n\nCAD is housed inside of the historic Fountainhead building on South Halsted, in Pilsen. CAD has roughly 7000 square feet of studio, exhibition, and event space, used in many different ways by our artists and audience. CAD hosts an eclectic calendar of exhibitions and events every month. In addition, Resident Artists often work with other organizations to host cultural events such professional development workshops, exhibitions, or fundraisers.. The hosting of outside events is part of an explicit goal to support Chicago organizations while connecting our Resident Artists to other professionals in the field.<br><br>\n\n<b><b>Arts Learning and Growth</b></b><br><br>\n\n<b>We encourage our community to \"Try It!\"</b> CAD is built around the idea of learning through participation.  Resident Artists are encouraged to participate in as many ways as possible. Resident artists have 24-hour access and often learn from bouncing ideas off of each other, while also leading and participating in programs that are extensions of their practices.<br><br>\n\n<b>We ask our community to \"Make It!\"</b> An important part of our residencies, programs, and critical dialogue groups is to make! To push to create -- not simply experiment -- and to strive to finish new works. This has been a core part of CAD's work since starting in 2004.<br><br>\n\n<b>We require our artists to \"Share it!\"</b> Chicago Art Department produces regular exhibitions, programs, and events in order to provide regular opportunities for artists to share work. CAD also pushes others to share via the web, print, and video, all with the goal of seeing  artists connect with audiences.\n", thumbnail: File.new("app/assets/images/galleries/chicagoartdept.jpg"), city: "Chicago", state: "IL", zip: "60608", hours: "By appointment only.", current: true},

Space becomes transformed to engage the senses in the desired environment for introspection as well as enjoyment.  Dance and music throughout history have been an integral part of community to confront, strengthen and heal.  As we gain awareness of a deeper level of self, we can stand in the river of experiences, joys, sorrows and challenges and meet life with grace and openness.  Music and dance inspire the spirit and cultivate healing and happiness.  POSTERCHILD relates this synthesis in performance with the use of original music, movement exploration, original costuming and video installation.  POSTERCHILD also offers yoga classes and LILA! (group ecstatic dance workshops), to provide the opportunity for the audience to become the mover and explore their own innate connection to dancing and music. <br><br>\nPOSTERCHILD currently performs monthly at their home base, TEMPLE Gallery, located in the Chicago Arts District in Pilsen East.  <br><br>\n\nDepending on the venue, event and artistic vision, POSTERCHILD can perform as an intimate duet between mover and musician, or as a larger ensemble, exploring a space as an installation or a featured performance. Based on the intent of the performance, the role of the audience may be that of observer, or take on a more interactive relationship with the development of the piece.<br> <br>\n\nPOSTERCHILD is a multimedia collective combining dance, music, visual art and fashion. Co-founded by Nadine Lollino and Bob Garrett, POSTERCHILD's collaborators include artists Flynn, Lyndsae Rinio, Brian Kallies, and many more. Over the course of the last six years POSTERCHILD has performed in Chicago, Hawaii, Denver and the Fringe Festival in Minnesota. POSTERCHILD is excited to have found a home base in Pilsen to create a transformative environment tailored to their artistic vision. <br><br>\n\nCo-founder Bob Garrett currently works with many different artists including Las Guitarras de Espana, John Elmquist, Anne Harris, and Toque Chicago.  Previously he performed and traveled as a percussionist for the National Tour of the Lion King, worked as a free-lance musician and producer in Chicago, working with Freddy Jones Band, Trinity Irish Dancers, and many more. Nadine Lollino choreographs, performs and designs/creates the garments for POSTERCHILD.

My experience as an immigrant, a Chinese American, a woman, a teacher, a curator, and an art historian has provided me with invaluable resources to draw from.

I use portraiture and figurative forms to offer a critical view to examine my own social and political environment.<br><br>   \n\nFantasy is not my concern, I strive to paint realistically and to accurately reveal the spirits of my subjects. Artists like Dutch master Rembrandt, nineteenth century painter William-Adolphe Bouguereau and contemporary portrait artist Daniel Greene inspire me for their dedication to their crafts. Their works demonstrate their superlative techniques in capturing their subjects'likeness and to convey the ideal of human spirit.<br><br>  \n\nOil on canvas is my main medium but I also use acrylic and employ collage technique in my work. I have painted homeless folk musicians, a Romanian gypsy girl, an Islamic human rights lawyer and restaurant customers. I believe in the importance of continuing to evolve and grow as an artist. Artists should constantly challenge themselves and explore new ways of artmaking. I would like to experiment with more subject matters and styles including landscape and abstraction. My knowledge in Asian art history also provides me an alternative perspective in looking at art.<br><br>  \n \nAs an artist, I constantly examined how I can create meaningful work that speaks for the history of our time and my experience as a citizen of the world. -Yu Huang\n\n", thumbnail: File.new("app/assets/images/galleries/ylh-studio.jpg"), city: "Chicago", state: "IL", zip: "60608", hours: "By appointment only.", current: true}
