We here at 4Art Inc gallery are proud to be rooted in such a creative arena.  <br>\n<br>\n4Art has exhibited a diversity of talented and dedicated artists since October 2003.   We aspire to empower our artists by providing them with a six month residency to show an evolution of their work.  The concept was simple; create a venue in which over a dozen talented and dedicated artists would rotate new works each month.  This idea was designed to promote a continuous visibility for artists as well as help artists and potential collectors form an all important connection. <br><br>  <br>\n <br>\nRobin M. Rios, owner of 4Art gallery, believes that in todayys art world it is essential for artists to be visible for longer periods of time in a single location.  Therefore it is at the 4Art Inc gallery where a client can watch an artist grow in an environment that is just as warm and inviting as walking into an artistts studio.  4Art is open five days a week and is one of the most prominent galleries in the Chicago Artistts District, Pilsen area.  Robin takes great pleasure in greeting and talking with her guests about the artists and the concept behind the group shows.<br><br><br>\n<br>\nWhen all is said and done, I want people to leave my gallery with a smile and with a new found appreciation for not only the artwork, but for the artists who create it.  I want people to find themselves excited about art and leave with an anticipation of returning and perhaps for their very first time becoming a collector.  Perhaps this is just a stepping stoneeto breathing new life into the art world.  Could it be as simple as just reaching out?  As artists we can sometimes find ourselves hiding in the dark, as an artists life isnnt an easy one to lead.  But since opening the gallery in October 2003, I feel that it has become my mission to continue to bring artists out into the light and help them, once again, find that excitement for creating art..<br>\n<br>\n\nReceptions: 2nd Fridays<br>\n<br>\nOther Services: CUSTOM FRAMING, GRAPHIC DESIGN, ART CLASSES<br>\n", thumbnail: File.new("app/assets/images/galleries/4art-inc-gallery.jpg"), city: "Chicago", state: "IL", zip: "60608", hours: "By appointment only.", current: false},

Alas, access to the rear of a building requiring a stair replacement forced a subject that many urban dwellers fear: the loss of a tree. That necessary act became the inspiration to somehow keep the tree as part of the community, and the concept for Grove was born. <br><br>\n\nThe tree would not just be felled, it would be deconstructed and then reconstructed as a site-specific installation. The site: a retail storefront, fourteen feet high, twenty feet wide, and thirty-five feet deep. The tree: approximately sixty feet in height, with a canopy of roughly thirty feet. <br><br>\n\nAll elements from the installation came from this one tree. The artists used a lift to gain access to the upper portions. Working at a height of approximately forty feet, each cut was carefully considered so that the end result was five full size \"trees\", rather than the many \"branches\" generally created by a tree being felled. After much deliberation the first cut was made, producing the perfect result - a full size tree of approximately fourteen feet in height with a canopy of approximately seven feet. <br><br>\n\nThis perfection inspired the next steps in the site-specific installation, and the organic architecture of the tree was used to create a Grove growing inside a space. The juxtaposition of nature's architecture against the manmade form posed an unexpected change in relationship with the interior space. The artists were then inspired to continue the act of creating space, and the Grove took shape as a circular ceremonial space. Trees trunks provide defined space or walls, and the canopy provides a sense of protected space inside the larger built space. <br><br>\n\nAs the cutting and felling of the tree continued, the artists were inspired by leaves drifting to the ground and decided to further develop the idea of sacred or protected space by giving it a carpet of leaves, the smell and the delicate blanket offering that sense of peace found when in a forest in fall. <br><br>\n", thumbnail: File.new("app/assets/images/galleries/grove-4.jpg"), city: "Chicago ", state: "IL", zip: "60608", hours: "By appointment only.", current: false},

Her next journey would take her through South America and finally land in Colorado as owner of a small but profitable cafe in Boulder. In Colorado, she exhibited her work in Boulder and Denver, meeting fellow gallery artist Scott Multer and forming a bond that would last and lead up to their marriage. After a brief stint in California, Bridget and Scott arrived back in Chicago to revive their artistic endeavors and begin planting roots in her hometown. On September 11, 2001, a tragic day in America, they welcomed the arrival of their daughter, Annabel. The beginning of their family ushered in a return to her work of creating from that which is invisible.<br><br>\n\nIn Bridget's work today, she utilizes pen and ink to draw a narrative of imaginary figures and settings which transcend the physical world, portraying a wider vision of awareness including spiritual and mystical themes.<br><br>\n\nScott Multer<br>\nStarting his career in the late 1980s as a comic book artist and serving as a graphic novelist adapting Anne Rice's vampire books, Scott brought his love for narrative art to the Denver gallery scene. Here Scott met fellow artist, future wife and partner in the South Halsted Gallery, Bridget Bolger. Struggling to make ends meet as a fine artist, he turned once again to commercial art, specifically in the digital form as an entertainment software illustrator in California. His progression in the field led towards interactive art direction with a job first at Playboy and ultimately following a career in providing creative direction and marketing solutions for corporations in Chicago.<br><br>\n\nIn a return to his work today, Scott takes a unique approach to the visual form by collaborating with his wife Bridget to create a shared vision and experience.<br><br>\n\n\n\n\nContact<br>\nSouth Halsted Gallery<br>\n1825 South Halsted<br>\nChicago, IL 60608<br>\n\nsohachicago@gmail.com<br>\n312-804-8962<br>\nwww.sohachicago.com<br>", thumbnail: File.new("app/assets/images/galleries/IMG_0697.jpg"), city: "Chicago, IL", state: "312-804-8962", zip: "60608", hours: "By appointment only.", current: false},

Carrying on a tradition that began with her grandfather's career as a renowned pastry chef in Pakistan, Uzma has handcrafted a distinct collection of \"East meets West\" chocolates. She personally chooses every spice, flower and chocolate used at her shop, and she is pleased and honored to share them with you. <br><br>\n\nUzma began her journey in the culinary arts at the Colorado Mountain Culinary Institute in Keystone. There she explored a wide variety of cooking styles and influences but it was the idea that chocolate could serve as an artistic medium that interested her most.  Being an avid traveler, it only seemed natural that she refine her palette by tasting her way across the globe--from her native Pakistan to Andalusia and France. What finally lured her home to Chicago was an opportunity to study under the expertise of the chefs at the French Pastry School. There she not only earned her *Art de la Patisserie* but continued on as an intern to integrate her new knowledge with her personality. It was her chance to develop her own unique style.  She went on to collaborate with several Chicago area caterers--taking on the challenge of balancing high volume and the highest quality production. While serving as Head Pastry Chef at Wolfgang Puck at Chicago's Museum of Contemporary art, her surroundings inspired her to develop new tastes and visuals to adorn her chocolates. <br><br>\n\nUzma shares her excitement for the art of chocolate at Triton College, where she has served as adjunct faculty since 2006.\n", thumbnail: File.new("app/assets/images/galleries/uzma-chocolat.jpg"), city: "Chicago", state: "IL", zip: "60608", hours: "By appointment only.", current: false},
